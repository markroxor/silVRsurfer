### A Virtual Reality based real-life scenario simulator

The objective is to interface the real world with the virtual world with as less resources as possible. This can primarily be used to train people for working in hazardous environments in which physical injuries are imminent . For instance training a military personnel for manoeuvring a jet plane.

As a prototype we are simulating our movements while manoeuvring a skateboard in the virtual world. Our setup comprises of two circuitry, the one which will sense the movements of the skateboard will be strapped on it and the other will be strapped on to the VR headset (Google Cardboard in our case ). The readings of the movements will be serially sent to the circuit strapped to the headset which will then map those readings to the movements in the virtual world.

Here, we have simulated skateboarding, which, in real life needs a lot of practice to master. We have strapped some sensors on the skateboard which continiously sends user orientation data to the VR headset, which in turn, makes user experience immersible virtual world of skateboarding.
